## 🔧 PROJECT TOOLS AND COMMANDS

### Natural Language Commands (if .ai/NATURAL_LANGUAGE_COMMANDS.md exists):
- `check the board` → Quick status overview
- `works ready` → Integration workflow
- `[custom command]` → [Project-specific meaning]

### File Size Restrictions:
- **Maximum file size:** [e.g., 2000 lines, 100KB]
- **Large file handling:** [Strategy for oversized files]
- **AI handoff requirements:** [File size limits for collaboration]

### Process Management:

**Integration Note:** These project rules work WITH the general AI rules, not instead of them. When in doubt, choose the approach that is more comprehensive and follows holistic principles.

**Validation:** AI must demonstrate understanding of both general AND project-specific requirements before beginning work.
