## Progress Log

### 21:26:32 - Repository Research
Found SimpleCP is a GitHub repository that originally contained this framework. Need to clone it to update framework copy.

### 21:27:22 - Framework Analysis
SimpleCP has older framework version - missing rules/, scripts/, .claude/ directories. Will copy updated framework while preserving existing SimpleCP-specific files.

### 21:28:51 - Checkpoint
**Status:** Successfully copied all framework directories to SimpleCP

### 21:29:50 - Push Failed
Git push failed due to authentication issue. Changes are committed locally but not pushed to remote. User may need to configure authentication or push manually.

### 21:30:24 - Checkpoint
**Status:** Framework update completed in SimpleCP - commit ed13e54 created with all verification-first protocol files
