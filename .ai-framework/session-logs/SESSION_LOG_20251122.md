## Progress Log

### 21:26:32 - Repository Research
Found SimpleCP is a GitHub repository that originally contained this framework. Need to clone it to update framework copy.

### 21:27:22 - Framework Analysis
SimpleCP has older framework version - missing rules/, scripts/, .claude/ directories. Will copy updated framework while preserving existing SimpleCP-specific files.

### 21:28:51 - Checkpoint
**Status:** Successfully copied all framework directories to SimpleCP
