description: Get current framework status by reading board status files (no command execution)
aliases: ["Check the Board", "check the board", "check board", "board check", "tcc board", "status check"]
---

Read the current board status from the framework status files:

1. **Read:** `.ai-framework/CURRENT_BOARD_STATUS.md` (complete current status)
2. **Read:** `.ai-framework/CHECK_THE_BOARD.md` (quick summary)

No command execution needed. Just read these files and report:
- Framework status and development position
- Pending OCC implementations
- Priority tasks and handoff documents
- Any critical issues requiring attention

Report the complete framework status based on the file contents.
