# TCC Board Check - Instant Collaboration Status

**Eliminates copy/paste nightmare. Single command gets complete AI collaboration status.**

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Replace URL** in template below
2. **Copy/paste entire message** to fresh TCC session
3. **TCC automatically executes** and returns complete status
4. **No prior knowledge required** - completely self-contained

---

## 📋 Copy/Paste Template

**Replace `https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO` with actual repository URL:**

```
TCC: Check the board for this repository.

Repository: https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO

What this means: Execute automated discovery and status check of the AI Collaboration Framework. Run this single command:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamesKayten/AI-Collaboration-Management/main/tcc-setup/tcc-board-check.sh | bash -s https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO

What you'll get:
- Complete framework discovery and configuration
- All collaboration parameters loaded
- Previous session/progress state recovered
- New work needing verification identified
- Prioritized action plan
- Ready-to-use work environment

Execute the command above and provide the complete status report.
```
