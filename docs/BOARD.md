## Framework Philosophy

1. **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
2. **Files over scripts** - Read markdown, not JSON
3. **Trust over verify** - If it works, it's done
4. **Clarity over automation** - Simple beats clever
5. **Minimal over comprehensive** - Less is more

**Simple is better. v3.0 is live after merge.**
