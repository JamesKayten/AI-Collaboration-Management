## What Changed in v3.0

**MAJOR SIMPLIFICATION:**

**Removed:**
- 6,000 lines of over-engineered code
- Proof-of-completion systems
- Natural language parsers
- Caching systems
- Monitoring/enforcement

**Replaced with:**
- 185 lines of simple code

## Framework Philosophy

1. **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
2. **Files over scripts** - Read markdown, not JSON
3. **Trust over verify** - If it works, it's done
4. **Clarity over automation** - Simple beats clever
5. **Minimal over comprehensive** - Less is more

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamesKayten/AI-Collaboration-Management.git
cd AI-Collaboration-Management
```

Read `BOARD.md` and `TASKS.md`. Done.
