## TCC's Three Responsibilities (Now Enforced)

### 1. File Verification
Validate code quality, run tests, check linters

### 2. Merge to Main Branch
Push passing code to GitHub main

### 3. Duplicate Everything Locally
Update local working directory - **CRITICAL**

**All three steps documented in TCC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md and /works-ready command**

## Framework Philosophy

1. **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
2. **Files over scripts** - Read markdown, not JSON
3. **Trust over verify** - If it works, it's done
4. **Clarity over automation** - Simple beats clever
5. **Minimal over comprehensive** - Less is more

**Simple is better. v3.0 is live.**
