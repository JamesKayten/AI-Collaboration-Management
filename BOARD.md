## 🚨 TCC: MERGE TASKS REQUIRED - EXECUTE NOW

### Task 1: Merge SimpleCP Sync Fix

```bash
cd /Volumes/User_Smallfavor/Users/Smallfavor/SimpleCP
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

**What this does:** Pushes sync script path fix to GitHub (Linux couldn't push)

---

### Task 2: Merge AICM Streamlined Rules to Main

```bash
cd /Volumes/User_Smallfavor/Users/Smallfavor/AI-Collaboration-Management
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git merge origin/claude/streamline-rules-error-prevention-011F1fZ47653uHAyxCkmJK7y --no-ff -m "Merge streamlined rules v2.0: 50% reduction for fast execution"
git push origin main
```

**What this does:** Merges streamlined rules into main branch

---

## After Both Tasks Complete

✅ SimpleCP sync scripts work correctly
✅ AICM has streamlined rules in main
✅ Everything synchronized
✅ Framework ready for use

---

## What Was Completed

**Streamlined Rules v2.0:**
- 50% reduction: 1012 → 509 lines
- Action-oriented format with executable commands
- Scannable checklists for fast compliance
- All error prevention protocols preserved

**Files Streamlined:**
- GENERAL_AI_RULES.md: 214→114 lines
- STARTUP_PROTOCOL.md: 250→143 lines
- FRONTEND_TESTING_RULES.md: 238→111 lines
- REPOSITORY_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md: 310→141 lines

**Role Enforcement Created:**
- OCC_TCC_ROLES.md: Establishes developer/PM division
- Pre-commit hook: Blocks TCC from code commits
- Install script: Easy deployment

## Framework Philosophy

1. **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
2. **Files over scripts** - Read markdown, not JSON
3. **Trust over verify** - If it works, it's done
4. **Clarity over automation** - Simple beats clever
5. **Minimal over comprehensive** - Less is more

---

**Simple is better. v3.0 is live after merge.**
