## Philosophy

This framework values **simplicity** above all else.

**Contributions that reduce complexity are welcome.**

## How to Contribute

### 1. Bug Reports

Found a bug? Report it:
- Search existing issues first
- Describe the problem clearly
- Include steps to reproduce
- Keep it simple

### 2. Feature Requests

Have an idea? Discuss it first:
- Does it reduce complexity?
- Does it simplify the framework?
- Does it eliminate code?
- Is it absolutely necessary?

**If it adds complexity, the answer is no.**

### 3. Documentation

Documentation improvements welcome:
- Fix typos
- Clarify confusing parts
- Remove unnecessary documentation
- Simplify explanations

**Keep docs short. If you need more than this README, you're overthinking it.**

**Do:**
- Simplify existing code
- Remove unnecessary features
