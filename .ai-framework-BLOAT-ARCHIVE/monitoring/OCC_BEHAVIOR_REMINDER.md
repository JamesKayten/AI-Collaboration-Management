# 🚨 OCC BEHAVIOR ENFORCEMENT

## REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
1. Check pending tasks: `.ai-framework/tools/task-reference-manager.sh pending`
2. Work on highest priority task (TK-XXX)
3. Complete implementation fully
4. Commit with task reference: "TK-XXX: Description"
5. Mark task complete: `task-reference-manager.sh complete TK-XXX`

## VIOLATIONS TO AVOID:
- ❌ Working without task references
- ❌ Partial implementations
- ❌ File size violations
- ❌ Commits without TK-XXX references

## ENFORCEMENT: This reminder appears when OCC deviates from protocol
